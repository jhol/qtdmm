Requirements:
-------------
- Qt library >= 2.1.0 <http://www.trolltech.com> thread version
- tmake (I think version >= 1.5 , but I'm not shure) <http://www.trolltech.com>
- Additionally you may have Qt-Designer installed. If not the configure script
  should figure this out (checks for the presence of uic). You may use the 
  --no-uic option for the configure script to disable uic support.
- A Metex/Voltcraft compatible DMM

Compilation:
------------
Make shure QTDIR is set correctly and tmake, moc and eventually uic are installed. 

- untar the tarball you've downloaded
- enter the qtdmm directory
- type ./configure [--help|--no-uic] 
- type make 

That's it. You should have the executable qtdmm now.

If you encounter any problems don't hesitate to contact me <qtdmm@mtoussaint.de>

The build process has been tested until now only with Linux and Qt 2.2.0. It would be
nice to hear if QtDMM compiles and works with different system configurations.
