Installation QtDMM 0.8 (c) 2001-2005 M.Toussaint

Requirements:
-------------
- Qt library >= 3.0 <http://www.trolltech.com> developer version
- A supported multimeter or a compatible model

Compilation:
------------
Make shure QTDIR is set correctly and tmake, moc and uic are installed. With
some of the major Linux distributions you have to install a qt-devel package
(or similar package name) in  order to get the header files for Qt, wich are
essential for the compilation.

* moc and uic  are part  of the original source  tarballs of Qt or  might be 
  hidden in a developer package of Qt for your distribution.

- untar the tarball you've downloaded
- enter the qtdmm directory
- type ./configure [--help] 
- type make 

That's it. You should have the executable qtdmm now.

If your DMM isn't  listed in the model combo  (list see README), just try to 
find manual settings, or a  compatible model. It is very unlikely that wrong 
settings cause harm to your DMM. Worst case could be that it hangs. 
Switching it off will reset it.

If  you  find  working  settings mail me  the result. I  will add it  to the 
presets and future users can benefit from you help.

If you encounter any problems don't hesitate to contact me
