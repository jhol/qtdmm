QtDMM 0.7 (c) 2001-2002 M.Toussaint

QtDMM is a simple DMM readout software including a configurable transient 
recorder. A friend of mine asked me  for a DMM readout software for Linux 
because he didn't want to use  the MS-Windows version which came with the 
multimeter. To help  him out I wrote this little piece of software.
The transient recorder features manual start, scheduled start (at a given 
time) and  triggered automatic  start when given  thresholds are reached.
It was written  for Metex (and compatible like VOLTCRAFT)  multimeter and
is known to work with the following DMM's:

    Metex        M-3660D
    Metex        M-3830D
    Metex        M-3850D
    Metex        ME-11
    Metex        ME-22
    Metex        ME-32
    Metex        Universal system 9160
    PeakTech     4010
    PeakTech     451
    Radioshack   DMM 22-805
    Voltcraft    M-4660
    Voltcraft    ME-11
    Voltcraft    ME-32

The following models should work but need to be confirmed by a user:

    Voltcraft    ME-42
    Voltcraft    M-3860
    Voltcraft    M-4660A
    Voltcraft    M-4660M
    Voltcraft    MXD-4660A
    Voltcraft    VC 630
    Voltcraft    VC 650
    Voltcraft    VC 670

If you manage to  get QtDMM working  with a  digital multimeter different 
from the mentioned  above, or if you can confirm  one of the  unconfirmed
models please give a note.

QtDMM is kind of "works for me" software. I'm using it, I like it the way 
it is  and it seems  to be quite stable. It still needs some improvements 
but does it's job quite well.
