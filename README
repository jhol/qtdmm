QtDMM is a simple DMM readout software including a configurable transient 
recorder. A friend of mine asked me  for a DMM readout software for Linux 
as the  DOS  software he had sucked  a lot. To help  him out I wrote this
little piece of software.
The transient recorder features manual start, scheduled start (at a given 
time) and triggered automatic start when given thresholds are reached.
It was written for Metex (and compatible like VOLTCRAFT) multimeter. 
Until now it has  only been tested  with a VOLTCRAFT ME-32 but should run 
with other DMM's that support the same protocol. Feedback on this is much 
appreciated.

QtDMM is kind of "works for me" software. I'm using it, I like it the way 
it is  and it seems  to be quite stable. It still needs some improvements 
but does it's job quite well.
