QtDMM is a simple DMM readout software including a configurable transient 
recorder. A friend of mine asked me  for a DMM readout software for Linux 
as the  DOS  software he had sucked  a lot. To help  him out I wrote this
little piece of software.
The transient recorder features manual start, scheduled start (at a given 
time) and triggered automatic start when given thresholds are reached.
It was written for Metex (and compatible like VOLTCRAFT) multimeter. 
Until now it has only been tested with an Metex ME-32 and an PeakTeck-451.
The Metex/Voltcraft DMM's use a 14 byte format an polling. The PeakTech 
DMM uses 10 bytes continuous output (thank to Dr. Ralf Wieland for the 
patch). If you manage to get QtDMM working with a DMM different from the
mentioned above, please give a note.

QtDMM is kind of "works for me" software. I'm using it, I like it the way 
it is  and it seems  to be quite stable. It still needs some improvements 
but does it's job quite well.
