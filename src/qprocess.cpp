  \class QProcess qprocess.h

  \brief The QProcess class is used to start external programs and to
  communicate with them.

  \ingroup misc

  You can write to standard input of the started program. You can read the
  output of the program on standard output and standard error. You are notified
  when the program exits.

  There are two different ways to run a process: If you use start(), you have
  full control over the process; you can write to the standard input via the
  writeToStdin() slots whenever you want, and you can close standard input via
  the closeStdin() slot.

  If you know the data that should be written to the standard input of the
  process already when you want to run the process, you can use the launch()
  functions instead. These functions take the data that should be written to
  standard input as an argument, write it to standard input and automatically
  close standard input if all data was written.

  If you use a launch() function to run the process, you should not use the
  slots writeToStdin() and closeStdin(), since the result is not well-defined.

  Example: If you want to start the \c uic command (Qt commandline tool used
  with the Qt Designer) and make some operations on the output (the \c uic
  outputs the code it generates to standard output by default). Consider the
  case, that you want to start it with the command line options "-tr i18n" on
  the file "small dialog.ui" (notice the space in the filename). On the command
  line you would do that with
  \code
  uic -tr i18n "small dialog.ui"
  \endcode

  \walkthrough process/process.cpp

  A code snippet for this with the QProcess class could look like this:

  \skipto UicManager::UicManager()
  \printline UicManager::UicManager()
  \printline {
  \skipto proc = new QProcess( this );
  \printline proc = new QProcess( this );
  \skipto proc->addArgument( "uic" );
  \printuntil this, SLOT(readFromStdout()) );
  \skipto if ( !proc->start() ) {
  \printuntil // error handling
  \skipto }
  \printline }
  \printline }
  
  \skipto void UicManager::readFromStdout()
  \printuntil // Keep in mind that the data might be reported in chunks.
  \skipto }
  \printline }

  Please note that you need the quotes for the file on the command line, but
  you must not give the quotes to the QProcess: the command line shell
  processes the string and splits it into the arguments, but the QProcess class
  does not do this processing.

  The readyReadStdout() signal is emitted when there is new data on standard
  output. This happens asynchronous: you don't know if more data will arrive
  later. In the above example you could connect the processExited() signal to
  the slot UicManager::readFromStdout() instead. If you do so, you are sure
  that all data is available when the slot is called. On the other hand, you
  must wait until the process has finished before doing any processing. Which
  approach is best, depends highly on the requirements of your application.
